# Image Generation Using GANs 🎨✨

This project showcases the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for creating entirely new, realistic images. By leveraging the MNIST dataset, we train a GAN to generate unique images, demonstrating the potential of generative models in creative and practical applications.

 ## 🛠️ Project Overview 
 
### Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two key components:

- Generator: Creates brand-new images by learning patterns from the original dataset.
- Discriminator: Distinguishes between real images from the dataset and those created by the generator.
- Together, these networks engage in a "game," improving iteratively to produce increasingly realistic images.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### Dataset Preparation:

- Load the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocess the data by normalizing and reshaping it for model compatibility.
  
### Model Design:

- Generator: Transforms random noise into structured images.
- Discriminator: Learns to identify whether an image is real or generated.
  
### Training Strategy:

- Both networks are trained simultaneously using adversarial loss.
- The generator improves by fooling the discriminator, while the discriminator sharpens its ability to detect fakes.
  
### Visualization:

- Generated images are saved and visualized periodically to track progress.
  
## 🎯 Key Highlights
